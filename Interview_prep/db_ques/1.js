const First = `if you your given huge number above 50 lakh of data given to you , 
how would you organize data , and how would you find duplicacy and reduce redunancy `


const sol = `
 a. Normalization:
   - Normalize the database schema to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
   - Break down large tables into smaller, related tables to eliminate data duplication.
   - Define appropriate relationships between tables using foreign keys.

 b. Indexing:
   - Identify frequently queried columns and create indexes on them to improve query performance.
   - Consider using composite indexes for queries involving multiple columns.
   - Regularly monitor and update indexes to ensure optimal performance.

 c. Partitioning:
   - Partition large tables into smaller chunks based on a partition key (e.g., date, region) to improve manageability and query performance.
   - Distribute data across multiple partitions to balance load and optimize storage.

 d. Sharding:
   - Implement sharding to horizontally partition data across multiple databases or servers based on a sharding key.
   - Distribute data evenly across shards to improve scalability and performance.

 2. Detecting Duplicacy:

 a. Unique Constraints:
   - Define unique constraints on columns or combinations of columns to prevent duplicate entries at the database level.
   - Use unique indexes to enforce uniqueness and facilitate efficient duplicate detection.

 b. Data Validation:
   - Implement data validation rules to ensure that only valid and non-duplicate data is entered into the database.
   - Use front-end validation and backend checks to identify and prevent duplicate entries during data entry.

 c. Automated Scripts:
   - Develop automated scripts or jobs to periodically scan the dataset for duplicate records based on predefined criteria.
   - Utilize database queries or dedicated data quality tools to identify and flag duplicate entries.`



const second = `partitioning and normalization both do similar work ? then what is diff`
    
const ans  = `Partitioning and normalization are both data organization techniques, but they serve different purposes:

Partitioning:

- Focus: Dividing large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks based on specific criteria.
- Goal:  Improve storage efficiency, query performance, and parallel processing capabilities.

- Impact on Redundancy: May not directly reduce redundancy, but it can improve efficiency in
  finding and managing duplicates within partitions.

Normalization:

- Focus:  Eliminating data redundancy within a relational database by structuring data into tables with
 defined relationships.
- Goal:  Improve data integrity, reduce storage requirements, and minimize the risk of data inconsistency.
s
- Impact on Redundancy:** Directly reduces redundancy by eliminating duplicate data across tables.

REAL-time use cases:

Partitioning :

Imagine a social media platform: User data can be massive. Partitioning user data by region (US, Europe, Asia) stores
data in smaller chunks. This allows for:
    - Faster queries: Retrieving posts for a specific region is quicker because you only search a smaller partition.
    - Scalability: As the user base grows, new partitions can be added for new regions.

Normalization:

Think about an e-commerce website: Order data can include customer details, product information, and order specifics.
Normalization can involve:
    - Separate tables: One table for customers (name, address), another for products (name, price), and a third for
      orders (customer ID, product ID, quantity).
    - Reduced redundancy: Customer details are stored once, referenced by the order table, avoiding duplication.
    - Data integrity: Updates to customer details in one table are reflected everywhere they're referenced.`
